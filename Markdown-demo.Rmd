## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Introduction
R markdown is a "R-flavored" version of the markdown formatting language. We use `.Rmd` files so that we can separate our code from our thinking, which also enables us to make elegant documents/slides/presentation/publication materials.

With R markdown, we can make styling decisions for our text. Here are some examples.

### Example 1 - Formatting text

You can use markdown to format text as **bold** or __bold__, *italic* or _italic_. You can make some text superscripted^likethistext^. You can also ~~strikethrough~~ text.  

You can put [links](https://www.natureupnorth.org) in your documments and add pictures (like this one of Gus)

### Example 2 - Lists
To make a bulleted list, use dashes, like so:

- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3

To make a numbered list, use numbers, like so:

1. list item 1
2. list item 2
3. list item 3
