## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

R markdown is a "R-flavored" version of the markdown formatting language. We use `.Rmd` files so that we can separate our code from our thinking, which also enables us to make elegant documents/slides/presentation/publication materials.

With R markdown, we can make styling decisions for our text. Here are some examples.

## Styling your R markdown document

### 1 - Heading sizes

Use `#` signs to control heading size

# Biggest heading!
## Next biggest heading
### Not quite as large a heading
#### Smaller heading
##### Quite small heading



### 2 - Formatting text

You can use markdown to format text as **bold** or __bold__, *italic* or _italic_. You can make some text superscripted^likethistext^. You can also ~~strikethrough~~ text.  

You can put [links](https://www.natureupnorth.org) in your documments and add pictures (like this one of Gus). Note that if you want to point to images without adding a code block, you should save your master markdown file in the project root directory (the same folder that has the .Rproj file).

![](Images/gus_exam_proctor.jpg)


If you add a code block, you can tweak the images more carefully and you can use `here()` to point to a folder of images.  For example:

```{r img-knitr, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='40%', fig.cap='Figure 1. A delightful dog named Gus'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("Images", "gus_exam_proctor.jpg"))
```


### 3 - Lists
To make a bulleted list, use dashes, like so:

- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3

To make a numbered list, use numbers, like so:

1. list item 1
2. list item 2
3. list item 3

### 4 - Other tricks

If you'd like to set something apart in the text to note that it is code, you can do so using backticks. For example, `mean()` and `sd()` are functions for determining location and range of a variable.

You can also create block-quotes to emphasize text. For example, if I want to take an excerpt from [this Mary Oliver poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=39077) and set it apart for emphasis, I can do so:

> The black oaks fling their bronze fruit into all the pockets of the earth

There is much, much more information about using Markdown, including how to do things like add citations, footnotes, tables, etc. etc. Check out these resources to learn more:

## Including Plots and Code
You already know that you can embed code in your markdown document (really,the ability to do so is what makes is "R markdown") and, with code, you can therefore also embed plots. For example:

```{r}
DF <-read.csv(here("Data", "growth.csv"))
```
Now that we have some data, we can do things to the data frame:

```{r}
str(DF)
```
Sometimes we may want to hide the code chunk and only display the output from the code chunk. We can do so by adding `echo = FALSE` to the code chunk opener, as follows. You see that we get the same output, but the code chunk doesn't display:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
str(DF)
```

Likewise, we may wish to focus on the code, and not on its output. We can control whether or not output displays by adjusting the code chunk opener, as well. Compare how the following two code chunks render:

Code chunk one displays the plot without the code:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(DF, aes(x = diet, y = gain, color = supplement))+
     geom_point()+
     labs(x = "Diet", y = "Weight gain, percent")
```

Code chunk two displays the code without the plot:

```{r, fig.show = 'hide'}
ggplot(DF, aes(x = diet, y = gain, color = supplement))+
     geom_point()+
     labs(x = "Diet", y = "Weight gain, percent")
```
You can also control messages:

Consider that you may not always want your "top of script" prep to display:

Here's the "normal" scenario for when you're just focused on your code
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
gus<-"A very good boy"
```

Case 2: Set up my script using exactly the same code as above but none of it will display.
```{r, include = FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)
gus<-"A very good boy"
```
