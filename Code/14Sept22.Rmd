## Overview
Below we will practice several ways of getting data into R

But first, let's add a standard code block that we will put at the start of all of our .Rmd files.

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #clear R's memory
```

### Method 1
Let's use the GUI to import the fake museum data.

When I don't copy and paste the code preview information when using the GUI to import data, there is no record of where the data came from.

A better choice is to copy and add a code block with the data path.

```{r}
library(readr) #turns on readr package
DF <- read_csv("~/Biostatistics F22/Barthelmess-InClass/Data/fake_museum_data.csv") #specifies file path to data
#View(DF) #opens data in a new window
```
