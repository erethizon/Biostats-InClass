Let's practice pulling in some data

But first, let's set things up

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) #clear R's brain
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```
 Let's use the import dataset GUI
 
 Paste the content from the preview window
```{r}
library(readr)
compensation <- read_csv("~/Biostatistics F22/Barthelmess-InClass/Data/compensation.csv")
```

 Now try another way using `here()` package
 
```{r}
nasty <- read.csv(here("Data", "nasty format.csv"))
```
